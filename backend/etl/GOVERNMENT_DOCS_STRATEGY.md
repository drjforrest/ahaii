# AHAII Government Document Strategy & Ethics Guide

## üö® Critical Security & Ethics Considerations

### The "African Kings Cyberpolice" Concern

Your concern about getting "too close to the African kings" and triggering cyberpolice reactions is **extremely valid** and shows excellent geopolitical awareness. This is a real risk that must be managed carefully.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Conservative Approach

### 1. **Explicitly Allowed Domains Only**

We **ONLY** access government documents from pre-approved, clearly public domains:

```python
government_domains_allowed = {
    "who.int",           # WHO is international, not sovereign
    "africa.who.int",    # WHO Africa regional office  
    "afro.who.int",      # WHO Africa
    "data.gov.ng",       # Nigeria OPEN data portal (public)
    "data.gov.za",       # South Africa OPEN data portal (public) 
    "opendata.gov.rw",   # Rwanda OPEN data portal (public)
    "data.gov.ke",       # Kenya OPEN data portal (public)
    "data.gov.gh",       # Ghana OPEN data portal (public)
    # NO other government domains without explicit approval
}
```

### 2. **What We NEVER Touch**

‚ùå **Absolutely Forbidden:**
- Presidential palace websites
- Military/defense domains  
- Intelligence agency sites
- Internal government portals
- Classified or restricted systems
- Parliamentary proceedings (sensitive)
- Cabinet documents
- Any `.mil`, `.int` (except WHO), or obvious sovereign domains
- Anything requiring authentication
- Anything behind paywalls or access controls

### 3. **Triple Safety Checks**

```python
def _should_process_government_doc(self, url: str) -> bool:
    """Ultra-conservative government document filtering"""
    
    # 1. Domain must be explicitly allowed
    domain = urlparse(url).netloc.lower()
    if domain not in self.config.government_domains_allowed:
        return False
    
    # 2. Check for sensitive keywords in URL
    sensitive_keywords = [
        'classified', 'restricted', 'internal', 'confidential',
        'cabinet', 'president', 'minister', 'parliament', 'military',
        'defense', 'security', 'intelligence', 'secret'
    ]
    
    if any(keyword in url.lower() for keyword in sensitive_keywords):
        return False
    
    # 3. Only process clearly public health data
    public_keywords = [
        'health', 'public', 'open', 'data', 'statistics', 
        'report', 'annual', 'publication', 'research'
    ]
    
    if not any(keyword in url.lower() for keyword in public_keywords):
        return False
    
    return True
```

## üìã Ethical Data Collection Strategy

### 1. **Academic Research Focus**

We position ourselves as **academic researchers**, not commercial actors:

```
User-Agent: AHAII-Research-Bot/1.0 (+https://ahaii.org/research) - Academic research on African health AI infrastructure
```

### 2. **Respectful Rate Limiting**

- **5+ second delays** between requests
- **Maximum 10 requests per minute** to government domains
- **Honor robots.txt** files religiously
- **Back off aggressively** on any 4xx/5xx responses

### 3. **Transparency**

- Clear identification of our research purpose
- Contact information provided
- Respect for data usage policies
- Attribution of sources

## üéØ Focus on Public Health Data

### What We Target (Safe Categories)

‚úÖ **Public Health Statistics:**
- Disease surveillance reports
- Health infrastructure assessments  
- Public health workforce data
- Healthcare facility listings
- Medical equipment inventories

‚úÖ **Open Data Initiatives:**
- Government open data portals
- Public health dashboards
- Development partner reports
- WHO country profiles
- UN health statistics

‚úÖ **Published Research:**
- Ministry of Health annual reports
- Health policy documents (published)
- Public health research studies
- Healthcare infrastructure assessments

### Data Sources Priority

1. **International Organizations** (Safest)
   - WHO, UN agencies
   - World Bank health data
   - Development partner reports

2. **Academic Institutions**
   - University research centers
   - Medical schools
   - Public health institutes

3. **Open Data Portals** (Government-sanctioned transparency)
   - Only officially designated "open data" sites
   - Clearly marked as public access

4. **Published Reports** (Already in public domain)
   - Annual health sector reports
   - Published policy documents
   - Public health assessments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Red Lines We Never Cross

### 1. **No Internal Government Systems**
- No intranet or internal systems
- No password-protected areas
- No unauthorized access attempts

### 2. **No Sensitive Political Content**
- No presidential communications
- No cabinet-level documents
- No political intelligence
- No economic sensitivity (beyond public health budgets)

### 3. **No Real-Time Intelligence**
- No current/ongoing operations
- No live government activities
- Focus on historical and published data only

## üö® Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **Geopolitical Awareness**

Each country has different sensitivities:

- **Nigeria**: Careful with federal vs state data
- **Kenya**: Avoid anything related to security apparatus  
- **Rwanda**: Extremely cautious with government data
- **South Africa**: Be aware of political sensitivities
- **Egypt**: Minimal government engagement, international sources only

### 2. **Technical Safeguards**

```python
# Conservative government document processing
async def _process_government_document_safely(self, url: str) -> bool:
    # 1. Triple-check domain allowlist
    if not self._is_explicitly_allowed_domain(url):
        return False
    
    # 2. Check for sensitive path patterns  
    if self._has_sensitive_path(url):
        return False
    
    # 3. Verify document is publicly accessible
    if not await self._verify_public_access(url):
        return False
    
    # 4. Limit processing scope
    if self._exceeds_country_quota(url):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### 3. **Legal Protection**

- **Fair Use**: Academic research purposes
- **Public Domain**: Only published, public documents
- **Attribution**: Proper source citation
- **Limitation**: Minimal necessary data collection

## üìä Alternative Strategies (Safer)

### 1. **International Organization Focus**

Instead of national governments, prioritize:
- WHO country health profiles
- World Bank health data
- UN Sustainable Development Goal indicators
- Development partner reports

### 2. **Academic Institution Partnerships**

Work with:
- Local medical universities
- Public health institutes  
- International development programs
- Research collaboratives

### 3. **Open Source Intelligence**

Focus on:
- Published academic research
- Development partner reports
- International organization assessments
- NGO health sector analyses

## üîß Implementation in AHAII

### Snowball Sampler Configuration

```python
# Ultra-conservative government configuration
config = SamplingConfig(
    # Minimal government engagement
    government_domains_allowed={
        'who.int', 'afro.who.int', 'africa.who.int'  # International only
    },
    max_government_docs_per_country=2,  # Very limited
    respect_robots_txt=True,  # Always
    delay_between_requests=10.0,  # Extra respectful
    
    # Focus on academic sources instead
    academic_focus=True,
    international_org_focus=True
)
```

### Default Strategy: Avoid Government Documents

By default, the snowball sampler **avoids government documents entirely** unless explicitly configured otherwise.

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: International Sources Only
- WHO health infrastructure data
- World Bank development indicators  
- UN SDG health metrics
- Academic research papers

### Phase 2: Academic Partnerships
- Partner with local universities
- Collaborate with research institutes
- Work with development organizations
- Engage international health networks

### Phase 3: Very Selective Government Data
- Only after establishing academic credibility
- Only from explicitly open data portals
- Only with proper institutional backing
- Only with legal review

## ü§ù Professional Recommendations

1. **Academic Institution Affiliation**: Ensure AHAII has clear academic/research credentials

2. **Legal Review**: Have legal counsel review data collection policies

3. **Diplomatic Channels**: Consider engaging through diplomatic or development partner channels

4. **Local Partnerships**: Work with in-country academic institutions as intermediaries

5. **Transparency**: Be fully transparent about research purposes and methods

## üõ°Ô∏è Summary: Better Safe Than Sorry

The enhanced ETL system is designed with **extreme caution** regarding government documents. The default configuration:

- ‚úÖ Focuses on international organizations (WHO, UN, World Bank)
- ‚úÖ Prioritizes academic and research sources  
- ‚úÖ Uses conservative rate limiting and respectful scraping
- ‚úÖ Avoids government domains by default
- ‚úÖ Includes multiple safety checks and filters

**Your concern about "cyberpolice" is well-founded and this system is designed to avoid those risks entirely.**

The snowball sampler's power comes from academic paper references and international organization reports - we don't need to get close to "African kings" to get excellent health AI infrastructure data!
