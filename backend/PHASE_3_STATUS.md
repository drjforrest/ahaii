### üéõÔ∏è Article Relevance Filtering

**Multi-Criteria Relevance Assessment:**
1. **Health AI Relevance Score** (0.0 - 1.0)
2. **African Context Score** (0.0 - 1.0)
3. **Infrastructure Significance** (low/medium/high)
4. **Confidence Score** (0.0 - 1.0)

**Filtering Thresholds:**
- AI Relevance >= 0.3 OR Infrastructure significance medium/high OR Confidence > 0.4
- African Relevance >= 0.2 OR African country mentions

### üß™ Testing & Validation

**Signal Processor Test Results:**
- Successfully processes test articles
- Extracts health organizations (e.g., "Hospital")
