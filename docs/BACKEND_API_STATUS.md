# AHAII Backend API Enhancement Status

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the AHAII backend countries API to fully integrate with the frontend carousel and provide real-time, automated country assessment data.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Complete API Rewrite
- **Converted from SQLAlchemy to Supabase**: All endpoints now use Supabase client directly for better integration with existing ETL pipeline
- **Removed database model dependencies**: No longer requires separate ORM models
- **Real-time data integration**: Pulls live data from ETL pipeline results

### 2. Frontend-Aligned Endpoints

#### `/api/countries/with-scores`
- Returns all African countries with AHAII scores
- Includes automated image paths for carousel assets
- Supports confidence filtering and estimated score inclusion
- Adds rankings based on scores and activity
- **Response format**: Matches frontend CountryCarousel expectations

#### `/api/countries/featured`
- Implements sophisticated featuring algorithm
- Balances AHAII score, confidence, recent activity, and regional diversity
- Returns 8 countries optimized for homepage carousel
- **Algorithm**: 40% score + 20% confidence + 20% activity + 20% tier weighting

#### `/api/countries/by-region/{region}`
- Regional filtering with full country data
- Sorted by AHAII scores within each region
- Includes regional country counts

#### `/api/countries/{country_id}/details`
- Comprehensive country profiles for detail pages
- Includes recent intelligence signals, infrastructure indicators, and health AI organizations
- Supports both ID and ISO3 country code lookups
- **Full data**: 20 most recent signals, all indicators, top 10 organizations

#### `/api/countries/recent-activity`
- Dynamic recent activity tracking (configurable hours lookback)
- Real-time intelligence activity monitoring
- Optimized for dashboard "What's New" sections

#### `/api/countries/statistics`
- Overall platform statistics
- Coverage percentages, tier distributions, average scores
- Data freshness metrics

#### `/api/countries/regions`
- Regional overview with economic and scoring statistics
- Population and GDP aggregations by region
- Regional coverage analysis

### 3. Image Asset Integration
- **Automated path generation**: ISO3 code to image name mapping
- **Asset types**: Flag images, country outlines, light/dark icons
- **Path structure**: Matches frontend expectations (`/images/countries/`, `/images/svg-icons/`)
- **54 African countries**: Full coverage mapping

### 4. Data Structure Optimization
- **JSON responses**: Exactly match frontend TypeScript contracts
- **Performance**: Efficient Supabase queries with proper indexing
- **Real-time**: Live data from ETL pipeline, no caching delays
- **Consistency**: Standardized response formats across all endpoints

### 5. Scoring Integration
- **AHAII methodology**: Integrated with scoring service
- **Confidence levels**: Transparent scoring confidence
- **Tier system**: Leader, Ready, Building, Emerging classifications
- **Dynamic rankings**: Real-time recalculation based on latest data

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
```python
# Core
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query, Depends
from services.database_service import DatabaseService
from services.ahaii_scoring_service import AHAIIScoringService
from config.database import supabase

# Data handling
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

### Key Features
- **Async/await**: All endpoints are async for better performance
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with detailed error messages
- **Data validation**: Input validation with FastAPI Query parameters
- **Documentation**: Full API documentation with descriptions and examples

### Database Tables Accessed
- `countries`: Main country data
- `ahaii_scores`: AHAII scoring results
- `infrastructure_intelligence`: Real-time intelligence signals
- `infrastructure_indicators`: Infrastructure metrics
- `health_ai_organizations`: Health AI organizations by country

## Frontend Integration Ready

### Carousel Data Contract
